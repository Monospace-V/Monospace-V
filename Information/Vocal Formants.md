You may have known that ancient Mayans used base 20 numbering systems, and ancient Egyptians base 12. You may have also known that we managed to translate their numbers long before we translated their language. I don't even know IF we ended up translating their language, and can't be bothered to look it up.

How do we define spoken language? We want to show the vowels and consonants mathematically in a way an outsider familiar with basic written language and our mathematics can replicate the sound of our spoken language.

This is where the audio spectrum comes in.

There are surely many experiences associated with earth no outsider to our language could understand, but let us pretend that we can explain our language to them; assume that we're capable of it.

Imagine creating a large complicated mindmap like thing for the sole purpose of explaining the language and what words meant. Translating each idea diagramatically. Taking the assumptions the outsiders read Left-to-Right and know what an arrow is supposed to mean. Also that they have a very strong understanding of maths.

We're looking at only English here, by the way. Your mindmap has virtually undefined size limits.

Let's also assume that with this strong understanding of maths comes an ability to understand our base and number system. The end result is that these outsiders can potentially understand written language. If we try hard enough, and are liberal enough with arrow signs.

But then there come in misspellings, culture differences in spelling (British English vs American English), and the like. All of which are hurdles one needs to understand spoken language to cross.

Vowels rely on something called vocal formants.


To give an example, have you ever heard a song pitch shifted upwards a few? Ever wondered why the vowels suddenly sound all weird and more "open"? (See nightcore remixes of songs for an example.)

The idea of vocal formants is that boosting certain frequencies in an audio spectrum give you vowel-like sounds.

Have you ever heard the shifting frequency boost effect thing in electronic music? The one where a sound goes "Eeeeeeaaaoooooooo"? That's caused by changing the frequency over which the audio boost is situated- from higher frequencies to lower frequencies, goes your boosted frequncy band.

(For anyone who bothers: This can be done with a bandpass filter, or a lowpass filter with high resonance- or even a highpass with high resonance if you're feeling daring enough. Hold a note down and pull the band leftwards from extreme right, or rightwards from extreme left. Definitely try at home.)

This is related to how vowel sounds are formed. Boosting a thin band of frequencies will make your tone sound like specific vowels. By "band" I mean a controlled range. The location of this band of frequencies on the audio spectrum determines how your vowel sounds.

The "formant" essentially means the frequency band which is adjusted to change the character of the sound.

Higher frequencied vocal formants sound like "eeee" and lower ones somewhere between a "mmm" and "ooo". In fact, this is why pitch shifted songs sound so odd. Pitch shifting spoken audio higher shifts its vowels higher too, relocating the formants. The words may still be decipherable only due to the _relative_ formants still being retained, but the difference is very noticeable. Vowels- all sounds, in fact- sound more "open". Similarly, pitch shifting a song _downwards_ makes it sound more "closed". Eitherways, it is bidirectionally absurd and an exponential embarrassment (after more than a little pitch shifting it starts becoming VERY obvious).

{Haha bidirectional absurdity and exponential embarrassments}

Of course, there's a bit more to it than just single boosted frequency bands, but that's the basic theory. For something more natural, I've seen two bands being used, rather than one. Actual vocal formants use multiple bands. See Wikipedia for a list.


Also, consonants can probably be represented by their frequency response on the audio spectrum, too. I won't elaborate on this, because I haven't as much information on it. Go figure. The S or hissing sounds will have noise along the upper end, T a noise along the lower end too, and the more nasal a consonant goes the closer it has to an actual frequency representing its sound as a tone. More than this, you can understand by immersing yourself in audio to the point it suddenly stops being nonsense and starts making sense. Or at least, as much sense as can come out of immersing oneself in musical audio rather than speech and vocal audio.

Point being, if we want an outsider to figure out our spoken language, we need to provide them with a key for how it works. One which tells you which frequencies to boost.

Frequencies. Hertz.

Cycles per second.

Do you see where I'm going?

If our outsiders knew how our frequency spectrum worked- that is to say, what we mean when we say "a 10-20k Hz accentuation of a hiss," then they could- hypothetically- figure out what to do with our frequency range instructions.

One hertz is one cycle per second. A cycle is easy enough to define. I won't do it.

We need to define a second, in order for them to figure out what to do with our language.

So here's this definition of a second from the SI dudes.

_The second is defined as being equal to the time duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the fundamental unperturbed ground-state of the caesium-133 atom._

That's... it, regarding the vowels, I think.

The rest relating to waveform and the like? I don't know quite enough about waveforms and the like to give more details, but given the harmonics (or lack thereof) of a sine wave, the waveform is almost definitely gonna be important if we want any response at all to boost (you can only boost something that's already there). The more textbook word for waveform is timbre, approximately. When you look at an eighth-grade physics textbook and read the sound chapter, then it's the timbre that differentiates instruments. They mean the shape of the wave, of course. A sine wave typically has only a single harmonic- that of the frequency it represents, also known as the fundamental harmonic. Different waveforms have different harmonics- a sine wave has the first harmonic only. The triangle wave has every odd harmonic- first, third, fifth... 2n+1th. The saw wave has every harmonic- first, second, third... nth. The square wave is like the triangle wave except the harmonics are of a comparatively higher volume (amplitude). Let me make this clear: You cannot test the vocal formants with a filter on a single sine wave. You are going to get an unimpressively non-existent result.

If you want- however unlikely it may be- _more_ information (on the assumption you've even read **this** article thoroughly), or want me to elaborate on something _else_ in my abrasive manner rather than reading it in boring polite-ese on google, then simply send a mail. Or something.

And no, I am not going to define waveforms. The "outsiders" thing, while forcing me to end up having defined a second, was simply an excuse to write an insensibly long rant on vocal formants. Plus, I believe physics textbooks do the waveform definition job well enough despite the unecessary additional nonsense. Defining things only makes sense on philosophical levels.
