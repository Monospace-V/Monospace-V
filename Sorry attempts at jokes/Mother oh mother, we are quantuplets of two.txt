MOTHER:
Oh!
Why, oh, why, has your father left me so?
Oh, the father of my children, my true-blooded sons and daughters
What are we, without you to support us?

CHILDREN:
Mother, oh mother, we crave food!
How badly we crave food. Meat and soups
Bread and butter and meals of rice
Our souls hunger so! Please, let us survive!

MOTHER:
Oh dear, oh my dears! Affirm my worstest fears!
I have no money left, no food and no deer
Your father, when he left, took with him his hunting-rifle
His right-hand bow and arrow, his weaponized super-spear

CHILDREN:
Mother, mother, our years are but two!
Quantuplets we may be, we have each a hunger too!
Why did our father leave us? Spare us this tragic tale.
Without our sole breadwinner, our lives will surely fail!

MOTHER:
Children, loves of mine and more,
I know the world is harsh and cruel.
Men like your uncaring dad
Are everywhere. They're not rad

CHILDREN:
What grave injustice, oh, did we do
That a man abandon his own children of two?
Five of them, no less, you see,
And without food, left us to breathe!

MOTHER:
Oh, darlings, my children, my grape and vine
Precocious dolls they are, but thine
Whatever did I do to thee
That you leave this task, their survival to me?

CHILDREN:
Mother, our bodies ache; put us to rest
You have no massage-oil, but you will do your best
Tonight we hunger, but go to bed
And trust you shall cry till the sun goes red
