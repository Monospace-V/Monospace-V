     HOW TO AVOID UPCOMING DOOM
   

I have been looking at the newspapers a lot lately, and it seems to me they're all trying to divert attention from an impending danger that is sure to happen: a sudden stampede caused by a mass migration of giraffes from Kerala to Madhya Pradesh.

I am not here to complain about how the newspapers do not tell us what matters. In fact, I completely understand it. There are so few people who ARE expert enough to advise us that even the people who AREN'T are terrified to make themselves look remotely like experts. They wouldn't want to lose a majority of their voters to unhappy accidents.

As one of the global twelve point five experts in the field, however, and modest as I am, I am completely willing to advise everyone on what steps to take. For free.


First tip:

Always carry an umbrella with you. Wherever you go.

Should a giraffe's head suddenly fall on you as you navigate your path to the nearby grocery store between its feet, you will be thankful you listened to me.
If the umbrella is red or black or really cool dark blue in colour, you get brownie points on the Monisha point-keeping bulletin board. Simply because those colours are nice, of course. And maybe you'll get a brownie...


Second tip:

Always carry your phone and loved one close at hand. Should a giraffe's head fall on an enemy who doesn't happen to have an umbrella, you and your loved one (who is under your umbrella. +A large umbrella is a bonus, you can shelter your loved one with you) can ridicule them and call up a few friends to do the same. It is very amusing, and at the most you will escape with a one-month jail term, if you call sitting in jail "escaping". I speak from experience. Also, you can videograph the incident for me to laugh at with you later.


Third tip:

The best way to escape when it seems like a giraffe is going to sit on you is by spontaneously imploding. In the unfortunate circumstance that you are coincidentally the unlucky fellow who a giraffe chooses to sit on, imploding surprises the giraffe so much it will almost definitely jump up and fall sideways a good few meters away from your (now fallen) umbrella. Warning: doing this when a loved one is in the vicinity is almost definitely going to leave the loved one in question with severe trauma. Weigh your choices carefully in cases like these.

Feel free to take advantage of the fact that giraffes are known to jump more than one point five football fields high when under stress.


Fourth tip:

If you do live this out despite the poor success rate of the few pieces of advice in existence, do invite me to cakewalk for a treat. They make the best brownies. The brownies are on you, of course. I saved your life. Surely you can be hospitable enough.
