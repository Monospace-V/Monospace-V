The world is spinning.

A bemused long haired girl is trying and desperately failing to list out all the brilliant good-for-society things the neighbourhood bank has done in the past few years. She's stumbling over her words, obviously failing, and not actually believing a word she says.

Listening to her, but wishing she was deaf instead, is a short haired girl, who is leaning against a wall, amused but mildly agitated. "Rile, I know you dislike arguing against people you have been associated with, but PLEASE- if you'll let me complain now and stop trying to justify their slack?" She doesn't imply she can feel the world spinning at the rate of about a thousand miles an hour.

The longer haired girl, presumably Rile, stops speaking and appears mock-affronted. She turns her head sharply sideways, ponytail bobbing in its wake. "I'm hurt, Jay," she says, trying to sound scandalised. (She doesn't feel the earth rotating, either. If she does, or is at least aware of it, we get no outward hint from her, as well.)

Jade takes this as permission.

"Look," she places her hands on Rile's shoulders, "Look at me. Do I look convinced? I am not convinced," she says, drawing her hands off and pointing at herself to drive the point home. "I'm irritated, and I _bloody_ well think those fools at the bank should know it. I know you worked there, but you didn't do their customer service business, you were just their legalese translator. You can't justify it. They deserved each and every punch in the gut they felt for their inability to use their politeness to behave as civilly as they speak. And let's face it, dear- even YOU have more sense than to misplace important documents and then suddenly bring them up when you feel threatened in person. Is it clear I'm giving you a direct brain-to-mouth train of thoughts right now? Cause I think it's clear. Direct brain-to-mouth, without any filter in between. I mean each word. Which I'm doing because..." she hadn't gotten this far, to the other end of the thought train. "I'm not sure. I don't know why I did it... made sense when I started, I guess."

She turns around to a mildly puzzled Rile.

"Huh? I presume you agree?"

Rile simply nods her head and lets Jade shift the topic, accepting defeat. She doesn't seem to want to argue, for some sudden reason. It could be the fact that she might be subjected to another verbal waterfall.

The world continues to spin, albeit in a slightly more huffy manner.

What it wants to be noticed, not ignored for once. It's been a whole hour it's gone without being acknowledged anywhere.

Earth, it is said, is quite an attention seeker.

It comes with being thanked endlessly and prayed to for generations upon generations, through almost all living human memory, and then, in what is a flutter of a butterfly's wings in comparison to earth's life, suddenly being ignored, being murdered.

This flutter of butterfly's wings...

The butterfly in question is in Brazil. The tornado set off in Texas may caused due to this butterfly's wings combined with a load of other things. But it's more likely the butterfly is merely symbolic.

Incidentally, at the time and circumstances of narration, there are no butterflies in Brazil. In fact, there are no butterflies anywhere on earth. Except for perhaps a lot of storybooks. We can now be quite sure the butterfly is merely symbolic.

The tornado was just going to happen anyways. It's a pity. Value your butterflies, folks; they've died out on another timeline at another point of time on possibly a different geospatial plane.

Rile and Jade are, fortunately or unfortunately, out of the way of the tornado, in somewhere completely unrelated to Texas in any way. The happening of the tornado may or may not facilitate our storyline, but does not appear to have established a direct link with it yet. It is simply worth mentioning that Texas _was_ harmed in the making of this storyline. But that's quite all right, it hasn't happened yet. It's waiting for us in the future, maybe it isn't, but you can't refer to records because the records point you only to the past.

(Monospace, Monospace, Monosapce. Neil Gaiman style already? or is this just how humorous storywriters turning to the script behave? Well, eitherhow: Too predictable. But okay. You'll roll with it. At least for now.)

Isn't the idea of a linear, one-directional time flow a wonderful thing?

But we're not here to debate that.

It's an odd number of minutes past late 'o clock now, and we're inside the tiny flat they share. Jade is halfheartedly muttering about how they should probably be asleep. Some time prior, she had been flicking through a book. At the time of speaking, she's staring at the same page. She clearly has little mental investment in the nonsense flying out of her mouth.

Rile is on her laptop. She's trying to search for something specific.

Well, _trying_ to search.

You see, at the moment, her screen shows the same screen it did fifteen minutes ago: the homepage of a search engine. She doesn't know what to ask, or even whether to ask. She felt like she had something to type in, but isn't sure what it is anymore.

She suddenly tunes in to whatever Jade's saying about sleep. Maybe they DO need some shut-eye.

She snaps Jade's book shut for her.

"I wasn't even reading- the image was simply conducive to having me think- *why, you*-" Rile's not in the room anymore at this point of Jade's complaining. She's packing for the night.

"Are you aware," Rile hears Jade yelling to her from the next room, "that it's very plausible an apocalypse take place very soon now? I need to think about it!" She meant to be spiteful, but she's too exhausted to engineer the snark into her voice.

Rile ignores her. Sleep deprived or not, Jade's always been a thinker. But only sleep-deprived Jade would wear her thoughts on her sleeve, where Rile of all commoners would hear them.
