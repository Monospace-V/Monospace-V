The first man shuffles a deck of cards. It is unclear how he can see them despite the darkness permeating the area. When the second man walks in and notices this, he presumes the first man has been sitting there for quite some time, if his eyes are used to the light or lack thereof. But the second man knows that, for that matter, the first man could have just shown up three hours into the future of the moment and he'd be none the wiser.

The first man is sitting on a chair next to a round table in a dark room. The second man walks up and considers sitting on the other chair, but chooses to sit on the table itself.

The first man gives no indication of having noticed the man on his table, still intent on shuffling his deck. He pulls a card out at random, examines its position in the deck carefully, and smiles up at the second man, who startles.

"Fifty-fifty. I like those odds, Tim." And he smiles wider.

'Tim' grins predatorily. "So we've got an assured win, you're saying?"

The first man's smile grows slightly wider than should be humanly possible. "No."

He pushes the Ace of Diamonds back to its place between the Seven of Hearts and the Twelve of Spades, mentally bookmarking the image of his doing so. "Your odds are about seven million times more likely than the Avengers winning Endgame. Eighty-nine thousand times more likely than your table breaking because you sat on it. Twenty-two times more likely than the success of Russia's hacking into Google back in 2017. Twice as likely as it was to rain this day a decade ago in Florida. This does not mean you have what you like to call an 'assured win'."

Tim does not know what Avengers, Russia, Google, Florida, or rain are, but he makes full sense of the 'seven million times more likely'.

The first man seems to catch on to this, because at this point, he reduces the intensity of his smile, so he can increase the intensity of his look instead. "Fifty percent a chance of winning is a pretty good chance you'll get what you want. But fifty percent a chance of losing, on the other hand?" And the man puts his cards down on the table, on the spot where Tim is now rapidly clambering off. The card man snaps, and the entire deck of cards turns upside down and fans out so the order is now visible. Every second card inches outward slightly, so as to show exactly how much half means. For each card edging out, he pretends not to notice how Tim edges backward slightly, as though afraid.

"Decent, but I wouldn't bet on it," he tells Tim, in what shouldn't be an ominous tone but is anyways, as though the universe willed it to be. And then the cards retract into the deck again, in a dramatic theatrical manner indicative of the sheer number of times he's handled his cards before. "It'll be amusing to see you try to fight the outcome of intangible but reasonable probabilities like those. I, for one, would... _like_ to see it."

A hole opens in reality, and the cards are stuffed into it by a seemingly invisible force, and reality bends again to close the hole, sealing and accomodating the cards in a little pocket dimension. Tim's eyes lock onto the place where the cards vanished, a look of longing gone before he realises it's there.

"I am powerful, Tim. But I am neutral. Don't forget that."

And card man's smile damps down to zero, but his eyes remain intense- almost as though he can see through Tim's mind, knows Tim is considering kidnap, threats, and blackmail. We can't see through anyone's mind, and therefore don't know if Tim is actually considering this.

"Don't try to threaten me," card man warns, "and I won't be a threat to you."

And reality twists, and forces another hole open. Card man steps backwards into it, placing an undefined actual distance between Tim and himself as he does so. It's as though he anticipates how Tim jumps and tries to run towards Card Man's portal. Card man vanishes, Tim suddenly runs the rest of the distance like a video that starts playing after a while of loading, and not a long second later Tim has stumbled and fallen.

Tim gets up, grumbling. From outside, a shrill, amused voice asks, "Any luck with Desert?"

He dusts himself off and laughs bitterly. "The dude's deserted me. Apparently he's here only to wave cryptic ideas in front of me like a carrot on a stick, and me to try and fail to get them like a _donkey_."

He sits back on the table, frustrated.

"Need I remind you," Gem calls unhelpfully from outside, "that he can _literally_ read your mind? And maybe see the future?"

The table breaks under his weight, and he finds himself on the floor. He sighs.
