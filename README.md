### Monospace-V
#### Hey there.

_You don't make the music. The music makes you._

****

My [music](https://lmms.io/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35299).

I also write stories and barely informative pieces of nonsense. And draw.
Might upload some files to this repo.

I also use [Alice](https://alice.org) sometimes, see [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h6H_IfB_YCdypGuahRy2I8pCPukXihEc) folder. I stopped using it after I tried to get camera movements precise and realise Alice randomized some amount of movement in on every run. Now the project I attempted to make is lying around somewhere.

- Reach me:
  - Create an issue on this repository.
  - Contact me privately via the [LMMS forums](https://lmms.io/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=9181) if it's related to music on LMMS (avoid using this option)

- I'm looking for help with: my Java calculator. See the repository for the calculator for more information on what.

- Fun fact: R' F R' B B R F' R' B B R R U' exchanges the upper two corners facing the cuber. Also rotates upper edges clockwise from top by 90 degrees, collateral damage. The fun part is, if arranged such that the upper edges are one clockwise rotation away from perfection and the upper corners facing the cuber need to be exchanged, this makes for a very dramatic last move, especially if the cube is flipped after completion and hits the palm with a satisfying smack.
