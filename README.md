#### Hey there.

****

My [music](https://lmms.io/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35299). mind they're old and obsolete links

I also write stories and barely informative pieces of nonsense. And draw.
Might upload some files to this repo.

I also use [Alice](https://alice.org) sometimes, see [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h6H_IfB_YCdypGuahRy2I8pCPukXihEc) folder. I stopped using it after I tried to get camera movements precise and realise Alice randomized some amount of movement in on every run. Now the project I attempted to make is lying around somewhere.

  - College
  - LMMS Docs
  - My website

<!--
  - Contact me privately via the [LMMS forums](https://lmms.io/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=9181) if it's related to music on LMMS (avoid using this option. I'm rarely active.)

- Find me publicly on:
  - The LMMS forums
  - The LMMS Discord
  - KVR Audio, for some reason
  - Understanding the GIG file format. I need to understand the sf2 specification first.
  - LMMS or music
  - Working on my website (it is up)
  - Articles on audio etc to put up on said website (I hope to explain well) 
  - Art
  - Attempting to learn the keyboard, guitar, cajon, and harmonica.


- What I've worked on or worked with: 
  - LMMS.
  - Audacity.
  - REAPER. barely
  - Hydrogen (drum machine)
  - Krita, Sketchbook, and Wick Editor
  - Embroidery and stitching?
  - Alice
  - Colour pencils? oil pastels? art? eh
  - Writing?
  - basic Python and SQL, Java, QBasic


- My resources: 
  - I have some slightly old books with old Christmas carols/worship songs and their associated sheet music
  - I have a quick and dirty Johnny decimal index creator/updater and a backup and mapping files utility bat file for Windows systems. the backup bat is robocopy-based.


< - Learning as much as I can about audio through mit ocw courses and the like. If you know a good course please let me know! 


- If you need a track made contact me. I probably need experience. here is what I will work with: 
  - Tool of choice: LMMS. can use Cakewalk if required but I'm not proficient. OnlineSequencer.
  - 3rd party: I have several VSTs and soundfonts. I'm not particularly fond of using too many VSTs since they take time to load. also can use gig, pat, sfz, sfark archives if required.
  - Approach of choice: If you have an idea in mind already for a tune and styling this is even better.
  - Short tracks that are auditorily interesting
  - Longer tracks only with heavy guidance
  - background scores where you plan to record other instruments over (also with guidance)
  - samples if any. I don't have a smart sampler that can detect and preserve the formants of a sample, or one that automatically loops to requirement.
  - Unusual time signatures, with guidance.


- What I will not work with: 
  - Most online music studios, especially those with dynamic content. includes Soundtrap and bandlab mix editor. I can but would rather not.
  - Most paid software. I am broke. I do not enjoy pirating audio software for general use.
  - Microsoft Excel. I don't like it.
  - I'm not versed music theory, sheet music, or playing a musical instrument. I'm learning, and if needed can reference, but I do not possess the skills just yet.
  - VST3. LMMS doesn't support it. I do not believe in the obsolesence of vst2.
  - High expectations of audio sampling rate or bitrate checking. just because I have my knowledge doesn't mean I have fancy studio monitor speakers. I do, however, have hearing issues. I'll export it at whatever quality I can give you but that's all.


- What I can work with: 
  - cajon if needed (I do not have a studio setup or high-end mic. noise is inevitable. I will do what I can to reduce it)
  - Vocal recording. can also do basic editing (noise removal, volume balancing) but avoid. my condensor microphone isn't high-end.
  - I have a torrent client, git, ytdlp, Audacity, and an evaluation version of REAPER set up among other resources in the event I should require them.
